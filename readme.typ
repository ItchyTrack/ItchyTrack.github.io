*PROJECTS*\
// *Organizer & Volunteer Teacher, Intersession Course in C++ Programming*
*Connection Machine* — 2024 to Present — Lead a 10-person development team in the Rensselaer Center for Open Source. Built a high-performance C++ simulation platform (Vulkan, SDL) for large-scale logic-gate graphs, targeting educators and hobbyists.

*Pose Tracker* — 2022 to 2023 — Implemented real-time ML human-body pose estimation using Google's MediaPipe and webcam streams. Designed a calibration pipeline for camera extrinsics and integrated with Scrap Mechanic via Lua scripting to control in-game objects.

*Independent Games and Mods* — 2020 to Present — Using Python, C\#, and a variety of other languages, implemented free-standing games and mods. Participated in “game jams” and collaborated with other game and mod developers across the world.

*3D Volumetric Renderer* — 2020 to 2022 — Created a ray-tracing engine in JavaScript, employing a hand-built differential digital analyzer (DDA) raycaster with Phaser 2D as a visualization engine.
