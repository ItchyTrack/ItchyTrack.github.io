			<h2>About MT Fast Logic</h2>
			<p>
				Fast logic is a mod created to improve the logic gates and tools in the game Scrap Mechanic. It adds block a replacement for the default logic gates that improves speed and adds a multitool that can be used to greatly increase the amount of logic someone can build.

			</p>
			<p>
				This project was made in collaboration with one other person. I worked on the logic gates and simulations. He worked on the multitool. We worked together to allow them to cleanly interact as one system.

				<h2>What does it do</h2>
				<p>
					Connection Machine is ment to be a high performant and more intuitive alternative to existing logic simulators. The app is written in C++ and is accelerated with Vulkan which also it to create very large circuits and simulate them at very high speeds.

			<h2>Cool Features</h2>
			<p>
				<b>WASM intergration:</b> Users can open WASM files that describe how to create blocks and then create dynamic blocks based off parameters set by the user.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Tensor Connect:</b> This is a tool that allows users to define arbitrary complex connections by repeatedly projecting connections across space.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Vulkan Acceleration:</b> We use Vulkan to do rendering which allows us to have 1,000,000+ objects on the screen. We also plan to move circuit simulation to the GPU.

		<!-- <p>With great optimization, comes great speed. Fast logic provides significant acceleration compared to vanilla logic gates and makes the use of logic for practical purposes much more viable.</p> -->

		<!-- <ul>
			<li><strong>Fast Logic Gate</strong><br>
				Behaves just like a vanilla logic gate, until you hover over it and press U. This will significantly increase the speed at which your logic runs. On top of this, fast logic gates allow you to change the color of their connection dot with the help of the multitool.
			</li>
		</ul> -->

		<!-- <h1>Silicon</h1>
		<p>Logic gates cause lag due to their existence, the calculation of physics, and the updating of logic
			states. The solution to this is to consolidate cuboids of logic into "silicon" blocks, which internally
			store all the data that the logic gates inside would have had and behave exactly the same. These silicon blocks are much better for game performance. A side effect of consolidating blocks together is that we can perform data compression on the logic blocks stored inside the silicon blocks, leading to significantly smaller file sizes. This means you can save much larger logic creations on your lift without needing to worry about spawning them.</p> -->
