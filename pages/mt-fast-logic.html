		<p>Fast logic is a mod created to improve the logic gates and tools in the game Scrap Mechanic. It adds block a replacement for the default logic gates that improves speed and adds a multitool that can be used to greatly increase the amount of logic someone can build.</p>

		<h1>Fast Logic</h1>
		<p>With great optimization, comes great speed. Fast logic provides significant acceleration compared to vanilla logic gates and makes the use of logic for practical purposes much more viable.</p>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>Fast Logic Gate</strong><br>
				Behaves just like a vanilla logic gate, until you hover over it and press U. This will significantly increase the speed at which your logic runs. On top of this, fast logic gates allow you to change the color of their connection dot with the help of the multitool.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h1>Silicon</h1>
		<p>Logic gates cause lag due to their existence, the calculation of physics, and the updating of logic
			states. The solution to this is to consolidate cuboids of logic into "silicon" blocks, which internally
			store all the data that the logic gates inside would have had and behave exactly the same. These silicon blocks are much better for game performance. A side effect of consolidating blocks together is that we can perform data compression on the logic blocks stored inside the silicon blocks, leading to significantly smaller file sizes. This means you can save much larger logic creations on your lift without needing to worry about spawning them.</p>

		<h1>Multitool</h1>
		<p>The multitool is a new tool that allows players to easily manipulate logic efficiently. It has functions
			that work with the rest of the mod such as converting to fast logic or silicon and colorizing the fast logic connection dots. It also has functions that let you quickly and effortlessly manufacture logic bycreating large amounts of connections quickly. Many tools allow you to shorten the time it takes tocreate logic from hours to minutes. On top of that, many helper tools are present that allow you todebug your logic quickly.</p>

		<h3>Here are just a few of the tools this mod adds</h3>

		<h2>Connection Shower</h2>
		<p>Allows you to see the inputs and outputs of any gate (Even inside of a silicon block). This is great when you have a mess of wires.</p>

		<h2>Parallel Connect</h2>
		<p>Connects rows of gates in parallel very quickly. Great for wiring up complex circuits.</p>

		<h2>Tensor Connect</h2>
		<p>Parallel connect's big brother. Makes orders of magnitude more connections than parallel connect
			efficiently.</p>

		<h2>Volume Placer</h2>
		<p>Have you ever needed <strong>a lot</strong> of logic gates in a cube? This is the tool for you!</p>

		<h2>One Tick Hammer</h2>
		<p>You can hit a fast logic gate with a hammer to pulse it for one tick.</p>

		<h2>Colored Connection Dots</h2>
		<p>You can change the connection dot color of fast logic gates to allow for better clarity within your circuits.</p>
