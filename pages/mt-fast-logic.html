			<h2>About MT Fast Logic</h2>
			<p>
				Fast Logic is a mod created to improve the logic-blocks execution system and tools in the game Scrap Mechanic. User creations are scanned to build an abstract representation of user logic, which is then transformed to apply simple optimizations. The resulting logic dataflow graph is executed independently from the game ticks, allowing much faster logic execution than the original game supports. The mod also enables coloring of logic-block outputs and edges, and provides a multitool that allowing users to more easily create and interconnect large-scale logic arrays.
			<br><br>
				This project was made in collaboration with one other person. I developed the logic gates, graph optimizations, and simulator. He worked on the multitool. We worked together to allow these pieces to cleanly interact as one system. The mod has been downloaded over 2,300 times.

				<h2>The Big Idea</h2>
				<p>
					This project focuses on high performance within a highly constrained execution environment, so great care was taken to run the logic as fast as possible while fitting into Scrap Mechanic's game system. I employed numerous optimization techniques such as disabling inactive gates (minimal recompute), converting gates to more optimal simulated versions (instruction selection), statistically based input ordering (instruction reordering for early exit), and combining gates together (instruction merging).

			<h2>Cool Features</h2>
			<p>
				<b>WASM intergration:</b> Users can open WASM files that describe how to create blocks and then create dynamic blocks based off parameters set by the user.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Tensor Connect:</b> This is a tool that allows users to define arbitrary complex connections by repeatedly projecting connections across space.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Vulkan Acceleration:</b> We use Vulkan to do rendering which allows us to have 1,000,000+ objects on the screen. We also plan to move circuit simulation to the GPU.

		<!-- <p>With great optimization, comes great speed. Fast logic provides significant acceleration compared to vanilla logic gates and makes the use of logic for practical purposes much more viable.</p> -->

		<!-- <ul>
			<li><strong>Fast Logic Gate</strong><br>
				Behaves just like a vanilla logic gate, until you hover over it and press U. This will significantly increase the speed at which your logic runs. On top of this, fast logic gates allow you to change the color of their connection dot with the help of the multitool.
			</li>
		</ul> -->

		<!-- <h1>Silicon</h1>
		<p>Logic gates cause lag due to their existence, the calculation of physics, and the updating of logic
			states. The solution to this is to consolidate cuboids of logic into "silicon" blocks, which internally
			store all the data that the logic gates inside would have had and behave exactly the same. These silicon blocks are much better for game performance. A side effect of consolidating blocks together is that we can perform data compression on the logic blocks stored inside the silicon blocks, leading to significantly smaller file sizes. This means you can save much larger logic creations on your lift without needing to worry about spawning them.</p> -->
