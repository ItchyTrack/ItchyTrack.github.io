			<h2>About Connection Machine</h2>
			<p>
				Connection Machine is an open-source, cross-platform desktop application I created for designing and simulating very large digital circuits. It provides an intuitive visual interface and a powerful simulation engine that lets users build and experiment with complex designs in real time.
			<br><br>
				I conceived and launched the project independently at the end of my first semester at RPI, and it became an official <span class="tooltip">RCOS<span class="tooltiptext"><a class="skip-link-color" href="https://new.rcos.io">Rensselaer Center for Open Source Software</a></span><span class="hitbox-larger"></span></span> project the following semester. Since then, I’ve led a team of 15 developers — 14 from RPI and one international contributor — to expand and refine the platform’s capabilities.

				<h2>What It Does</h2>
				<p>
					Connection Machine is designed as a faster, more intuitive alternative to existing logic simulators. Written in C++ and accelerated with Vulkan, it supports the creation and simulation of very large circuits at exceptionally high speeds.

			<h2>Cool Features</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>WASM Integration:</b> Users can import WebAssembly (WASM) files that define how to generate circuit blocks, enabling dynamic block creation based on user-defined parameters.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Tensor Connect:</b> A powerful tool for defining arbitrarily complex wiring patterns by repeatedly projecting connections across space.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Vulkan Acceleration:</b> The engine uses Vulkan for rendering, allowing over one million objects on screen simultaneously. Circuit simulation is also being migrated to the GPU for even greater performance.
