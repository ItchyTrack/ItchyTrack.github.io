			<h2>About Connection Machine</h2>
			<p>
				Connection Machine is an open-source project I started at the end of my first semester in college. It is a cross-platform desktop application for designing and simulating very large digital circuits.
			<br><br>
				I lead an <span class="tooltip">RCOS<span class="tooltiptext"><a class="skip-link-color" href="https://new.rcos.io">Rensselaer Center for Open Source Software</a></span><span class="hitbox-larger"></span></span> project to continue development of the app. Since spring of last year we have had 14 RPI developers and one out of country contributor.

				<h2>What does it do</h2>
				<p>
					Connection Machine is meant to be a more performant and intuitive alternative to existing logic simulators. The app is written in C++ and is accelerated with Vulkan, which allows creating very large circuits and simulating them at very high speeds.

			<h2>Cool Features</h2>
			<p>
				<b>WASM Integration:</b> Users can open WASM files that describe how to create blocks, and then create dynamic blocks based off parameters set by the user.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Tensor Connect:</b> This is a tool that allows users to define arbitrarily complex connections by repeatedly projecting connections across space.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Vulkan Acceleration:</b> We use Vulkanm to do rendering which allows us to have 1,000,000+ blocks and wires on the screen. We also plan to move circuit simulation to the GPU.
