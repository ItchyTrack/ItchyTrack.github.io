			<h2>About Connection Machine</h2>
			<p>
				Connection Machine is an open-source project I started at the end of my first semester in college. It is a cross-platform desktop application for designing and simulating digital circuits.
			</p><p>
				In my second semester I lead a team in RCOS (Rensselaer Center for Open Source Software) of 10 students to help develop the app. I again lead a team through RCOS in my third semester and plan to do so in following semester.

				<h2>What does it do</h2>
				<p>
					Connection Machine is ment to be a high performant and more intuitive alternative to existing logic simulators. The app is written in C++ and is accelerated with Vulkan which also it to create very large circuits and simulate them at very high speeds.

			<h2>Cool Features</h2>
			<p>
				<b>WASM intergration:</b> Users can open WASM files that describe how to create blocks and then create dynamic blocks based off parameters set by the user.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Tensor Connect:</b> This is a tool that allows users to define arbitrary complex connections by repeatedly projecting connections across space.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Vulkan Acceleration:</b> We use Vulkan to do rendering which allows us to have 1,000,000+ objects on the screen. We also plan to move circuit simulation to the GPU.
